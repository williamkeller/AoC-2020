# Advent of Code 2020



## Installation

`npm init`


## Running solutions

`npm start p d`

where p is 1 for puzzle 1, or 2 for puzzle 2
and d is the day of the puzzle, 1 through 25. Defaults to the current day, if not provided.


## Testing

`npm test` to run the unit tests. The daily puzzle code is generally _not_ tested, these tests are for the
support code.
