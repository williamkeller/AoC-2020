# Advent of Code 2020



## Installation

`npm init`


## Running solutions

`npm start p t d`

* where p is 1 for puzzle 1, or 2 for puzzle 2

* t is whether to run test data (t) or real data (f), defaults to f

* d is the day of the puzzle, 1 through 25, defaults to the current day, if not provided.
